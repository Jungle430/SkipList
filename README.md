A SkipList with GoLang

## Overview

This repository contains a SkipList implementation in GoLang (version 1.21.4), featuring probabilistic level selection and generic support for key-value pairs.

## Key Features

- Probabilistic Level Selection: The SkipList dynamically determines the number of levels for each node, ensuring balanced structure and logarithmic time complexity for operations.

- Generic Support: Utilizes GoLang's generics to accommodate key-value pairs of any comparable type for keys (K) and any type for values (V), enhancing flexibility and reusability.

- Efficient Operations: Provides efficient search, insertion, deletion, and range query operations with logarithmic time complexity.
